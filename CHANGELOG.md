## 0.10.0 - 2021-02-28 - Plot and polish

<img src="media/egui-0.10-plot.gif" width="50%">

### Added ‚≠ê

* Add `egui::plot::Plot` to plot some 2D data.
* Add `Ui::hyperlink_to(label, url)`.
* Sliders can now have a value prefix and suffix (e.g. the suffix `"¬∞"` works like a unit).
* `Context::set_pixels_per_point` to control the scale of the UI.
* Add `Response::changed()` to query if e.g. a slider was dragged, text was entered or a checkbox was clicked.
* Add support for all integers in `DragValue` and `Slider` (except 128-bit).

### Changed üîß

* Improve the positioning of tooltips.
* Only show tooltips if mouse is still.
* `Slider` will now show the value display by default, unless turned off with `.show_value(false)`.
* The `Slider` value is now a `DragValue` which when dragged can pick values outside of the slider range (unless `clamp_to_range` is set).


## 0.9.0 - 2021-02-07 - Light Mode and much more

<img src="media/0.9.0-disabled.gif" width="50%">

### Added ‚≠ê

* Add support for secondary and middle mouse buttons.
* Add `Label` methods for code, strong, strikethrough, underline and italics.
* Add `ui.group(|ui| { ‚Ä¶ })` to visually group some widgets within a frame.
* Add `Ui` helpers for doing manual layout (`ui.put`, `ui.allocate_ui_at_rect` and more).
* Add `ui.set_enabled(false)` to disable all widgets in a `Ui` (grayed out and non-interactive).
* Add `TextEdit::hint_text` for showing a weak hint text when empty.
* `egui::popup::popup_below_widget`: show a popup area below another widget.
* Add `Slider::clamp_to_range(bool)`: if set, clamp the incoming and outgoing values to the slider range.
* Add: `ui.spacing()`, `ui.spacing_mut()`, `ui.visuals()`, `ui.visuals_mut()`.
* Add: `ctx.set_visuals()`.
* You can now control text wrapping with `Style::wrap`.
* Add `Grid::max_col_width`.

### Changed üîß

* Text will now wrap at newlines, spaces, dashes, punctuation or in the middle of a words if necessary, in that order of priority.
* Widgets will now always line break at `\n` characters.
* Widgets will now more intelligently choose wether or not to wrap text.
* `mouse` has been renamed `pointer` everywhere (to make it clear it includes touches too).
* Most parts of `Response` are now methods, so `if ui.button("‚Ä¶").clicked {` is now `if ui.button("‚Ä¶").clicked() {`.
* `Response::active` is now gone. You can use `response.dragged()` or `response.clicked()` instead.
* Backend: pointer (mouse/touch) position and buttons are now passed to egui in the event stream.
* `DragValue::range` is now called `clamp_range` and also clamps incoming values.
* Renamed `Triangles` to `Mesh`.
* The tesselator now wraps the clip rectangle and mesh in `struct ClippedMesh(Rect, Mesh)`.
* `Mesh::split_to_u16` now returns a 16-bit indexed `Mesh16`.

### Fixed üêõ

* It is now possible to click widgets even when FPS is very low.
* Tessellator: handle sharp path corners better (switch to bevel instead of miter joints for > 90¬∞).
