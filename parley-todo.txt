Parley:
- Text truncation with ellipsis
- serde support for some types (the selection ones at least)

Here:
- Text overflow between different items doesn't wrap properly (see Font Book code link)
- Absolute line height (does Parley support this?)
- Figure out what's going on with baseline alignment (the monospace font does not vertically align with Ubuntu in e.g. the EasyMark right pane)
- Fix FontDefinitions and adding fonts
  - Get fallback/ordering working properly
- Investigate whether swash is being too conservative with its shape bounds and cutting off rendered glyphs
- Better texture atlas management
  - I think it's a bit broken right now
  - Automatically switch between multiple atlases if one isn't enough
  - Use etagere instead of rolling our own atlas?'
- Colored emoji
- Global/scoped RTL? Do we get bidirectional support for free?
- Better (more CSSish) font API
  - move font db into FontDefinitions
  - Families and not just files
  - Option to load system fonts
  - FontTweak is very not-implemented
  - Can we do bold now?
  - Letter spacing
- Strikethrough and underline
- Rewrite selection code to use parley's API
- Implement max_rows for wrapping
- Actually remove all the ab_glyph stuff
- Actually render text decorations (underline, strikethhrough, etc) and backgrounds

- Perf optimizations!
  - Stop using TreeBuilder so we don't have to allocate a bunch of strings
  - https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1098
  - Enable shape_run_cache
  - Use monochrome texture for font atlas (R8 format)
