Parley:
- Text truncation with ellipsis
- serde support for some types (the selection ones at least)

Here:
- Text overflow between different items doesn't wrap properly (see Font Book code link)
- is InlineBox the best/only way to offset the first line?
  - (I think it works well for now)
- Absolute line height (does Parley support this?)
- Auto fallback to faux italics (and perhaps faux bold)
  - run.synthesis()
- Fix FontDefinitions and adding fonts
  - Get fallback/ordering working properly
- Investigate whether swash is being too conservative with its shape bounds and cutting off rendered glyphs
- We don't need to do all the weird DPI stuff now, probably
  - (see https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3664 for an example of the hacks we can get rid of)
- A bunch of font atlas stuff
  - I think it's a bit broken right now
  - Automatically switch between multiple atlases if one isn't enough
  - There will not be any "the font texture" anymore
  - Use etagere instead of rolling our own atlas?
  - Use monochrome texture for font atlas (R8 format)
    - Does the current one only use RGBA so we can use the same shader for everything?
    - Probably needs support in the backends for mask-only textures (gl.ALPHA and whatever the wgpu equivalent is)
  - Have separate atlases for color emoji and glyphs/discs
- Colored emoji
- Global/scoped RTL? Do we get bidirectional support for free?
- Better (more CSSish) font API
  - move font db into FontDefinitions
  - Families and not just files
  - Option to load system fonts
  - FontTweak is very not-implemented
  - Can we do bold now?
  - Revamp TextFormat in general
    - Can it cascade?
  - Letter spacing
  - Hinting enable/disable
- Strikethrough and underline
- Rewrite selection code to use parley's API
- Implement max_rows for wrapping
- Actually remove all the ab_glyph stuff
- Actually render text decorations (underline, strikethhrough, etc) and backgrounds

- Perf optimizations!
  - Stop using TreeBuilder so we don't have to allocate a bunch of strings
  - https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1098
  - Enable shape_run_cache
