# This action builds and deploys egui_demo_app on each pull request created
# Security notes:
# The preview deployment is split in two workflows, preview_build and preview_deploy.
# `preview_build` runs on pull_request, so it won't have any access to the repositories secrets, so it is safe to
# build / execute untrusted code.
# `preview_deploy` has access to the repositories secrets (so it can push to the pr preview repo) but won't run
# any untrusted code (it will just extract the build artifact and push it to the pages branch where it will
# automatically be deployed).
