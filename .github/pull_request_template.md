<!--
Please read the "Making a PR" section of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a Pull Request!

* Keep your PR:s small and focused.
* If applicable, add a screenshot or gif.
* Open the PR as a draft until you have self-reviewed it and it is green.
* If it is a noteworthy change, add a line to the relevant `CHANGELOG.md` under "Unreleased".
* If it is a non-trivial addition, consider adding a demo for it to `egui_demo_lib`.
* When you have addressed a PR comment, mark it as resolved.

Please be patient! I will review you PR, but my time is limited!
