<!--
Please read the "Making a PR" section of [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/emilk/egui/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a Pull Request!

* Keep your PR:s small and focused.
* The PR title is what ends up in the changelog, so make it descriptive!
* If applicable, add a screenshot or gif.
* If it is a non-trivial addition, consider adding a demo for it to `egui_demo_lib`, or a new example.
* Do NOT open PR:s from your `master` branch, as that makes it hard for maintainers to test and add commits to your PR.
* Remember to run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`.
* Open the PR as a draft until you have self-reviewed it and run `./scripts/check.sh`.
* When you have addressed a PR comment, mark it as resolved.

Please be patient! I will review your PR, but my time is limited!
