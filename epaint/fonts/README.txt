 I. About this font

WenQuanYi Micro Hei font family is a Sans-Serif style (also known as Hei,
Gothic or Dotum among the Chinese/Japanese/Korean users) high quality
CJK outline font. It was derived from "Droid Sans Fallback", "Droid
Sans" and "Droid Sans Mono" released by Google Corp. This font package
contains two faces, "Micro Hei" and "Micro Hei Mono", in form of a
True-Type Collection (ttc) file. All the unified CJK Han glyphs, i.e.
GBK Hanzi, in the range of U+4E00-U+9FC3 defined in Unicode Standard 5.1
are covered, with additional support to many other international
languages such as Latin, Extended Latin, Hanguls and Kanas. The font
file is extremely compact (~5M) compared with most known CJK fonts.
As a result, it can be used for hand-held devices or embedded systems, or
used on PC with a significantly small memory footprint. Because both
font faces carry hinting and kerning instructions for Latin glyphs,
they are the excellent choices for desktop fonts.


 II. Development History

The original Droid Sans Fallback font contain 16,000 Unified Han glyphs,
and was officially released by Google under Apache2 license on Dec. 9,
2008 [2]. With a Javascript-based web interface, Fontopia(TM) [1], developed
by mozbug and Qianqian Fang, the WenQuanYi contributors had completed
over 10,000 new glyphs by combining the spline contours from the existing
Droid Han glyphs. By the end of 2008, project phase-1 had almost
completed, and phase-2 for CJK Extension A (U+3400-U+4DB5) was brought
online on Dec. 29, 2009. A review panel was formed to reinforce the
quality of all submitted glyphs [3]. In Jan. 2009, the reviewers
had redone over 2000 Hanzi and completed all the missing characters.
The nightly-build font has become online since Jan. 16. As of Feb. 2009, there
has been over 5500 CJK Extension A Han glyphs completed, which led this
font toward a complete GB18030 coverage.

In this font, we incorporated the high quality Latin glyphs from "Droid Sans"
and "Droid Sans Mono", which contain not only a better coverage but also
the additional hinting and kerning information. The EM of MicroHei
and MicroHeiMono fonts were unified to 2048 to retain all the advanced
typesetting features.


 III. Credits

We cordially thank Google(TM) for generously releasing Droid fonts to
public under an open-source license. Google purchased the font from
Ascenders Corp. (which was originally designed by a Chinese company).

The project for extending the Droid fonts is based on the web-based
glyph-composing applet [1], created by mozbug and Qianqian Fang
jointly. They are constantly improving this application targeting at
a web-based collaborative font development environment.

Over a thousand anonymous contributors have participated the project;
they submitted over 10,000 new Hanzi glyphs and many modifications.
The full update history of the glyphs can be found at [4].

The key members of the review panel, i.e. lsz, FangQ, kmc, Xhacker,
philacorns, and an "anonymous" (as requested) contributor, had
spent significant amount of efforts to redesign nearly half of the
submitted glyphs. We appreciate the incredible effort from this team
to make this font available. The detailed review credit can be found
at [3]

 V.    About "WenQuanYi Project"

The "Wen Quan Yi" Project [5] was founded by Qianqian Fang [6] in
Oct. 2004. The goal of this project is to create a web-based
collaborative environment for open-source type-face development.
The initial focus of the project is to create high quality bitmap
character glyphs and outline fonts for all 70,000+ CJK characters
currently encoded by the Unicode Consortium. Some of the fonts
released by this project have been widely used as the default
Chinese desktop fonts by main-stream GNU/Linux distributions.

The Wen Quan Yi Project uses wiki [5] as the primary development
tool for glyph creation, documentation and coordinations. Wen Quan Yi
wiki also supports glyph version control and nightly build.
