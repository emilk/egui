In cosmic-text:
- More flexible font fallback stack
- Ability to control leading space before the first line (added in upstream fork)
- Span-level styling of *empty* lines' height
  - https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/364
- Ellipsis truncation
- More CSSish font selection
  - Prefer members of the same font family instead of choosing a closer weight from a different family
  - If italics are not present in the selected family, automatically fake them instead
- Control over whether hinting is enabled
- Expose swash render_into for better performance
- Lazy re-layout/reshape (https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-text/issues/280); very important since we set many buffer properties

Here:
- Fix FontDefinitions and adding fonts
- Better texture atlas management
  - Automatically switch between multiple atlases if one isn't enough
  - Use etagere instead of rolling our own atlas?'
- Colored emoji
- Global/scoped RTL? Do we get bidirectional support for free?
- Better (more CSSish) font API
  - move font db into FontDefinitions
  - Families and not just files
  - Option to load system fonts
  - FontTweak is very not-implemented
  - Can we do bold now?
  - Letter spacing
- Strikethrough and underline
- Rewrite selection code to use Buffer instead of storing copies of all the glyph bounds
  - Also important for correctness--no longer a 1:1 mapping of glyphs to codepoints
- Implement max_rows for wrapping
- Actually remove all the ab_glyph stuff
- Use cosmic-text's fancy-but-hard-to-understand caching stuff for multiline text editing?

- Better way to get "default" line height than just getting it from the first line (affects EasyMark Editor)
- Actually render text backgrounds

- Perf optimizations!
  - https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/1098
  - Enable shape_run_cache
  - Use monochrome texture for font atlas (R8 format)
