//! Traits and helper for writing Egui apps.
//!
//! This module is very experimental, and you don't need to use it.
//!
//! Egui can be used as a library, but you can also use it as a framework to write apps in.
//! This module defined the `App` trait that can be implemented and used with the `egui_web` and `egui_glium` crates.

// TODO: move egui/src/app.rs to own crate, e.g. egui_framework ?

/// Implement this trait to write apps that can be compiled both natively using the [`egui_glium`](https://crates.io/crates/egui_glium) crate,
/// and deployed as a web site using the [`egui_web`](https://crates.io/crates/egui_web) crate.
