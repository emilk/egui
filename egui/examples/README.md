There are no stand-alone egui examples, because egui is not stand-alone!

There are plenty of examples in [the online demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo). You can find the source code for it at <https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/egui_demo_lib>.

If you are using `eframe`, the [crate examples](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/examples) and [single-file examples](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/eframe/examples).
To learn how to set up `eframe` for web and native, go to <https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/> and follow the instructions there!
