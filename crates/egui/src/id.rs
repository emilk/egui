/// the sliders [`Id`] as the current active id so that next frame when
/// you move the mouse the same slider changes, even if the mouse has
/// moved outside the slider.
///
/// For some widgets [`Id`]s are also used to persist some state about the
/// widgets, such as Window position or whether not a collapsing header region is open.
///
/// This implies that the [`Id`]s must be unique.
///
/// For simple things like sliders and buttons that don't have any memory and
/// doesn't move we can use the location of the widget as a source of identity.
/// For instance, a slider only needs a unique and persistent ID while you are
/// dragging the slider. As long as it is still while moving, that is fine.
///
/// For things that need to persist state even after moving (windows, collapsing headers)
/// the location of the widgets is obviously not good enough. For instance,
/// a collapsing region needs to remember whether or not it is open even
/// if the layout next frame is different and the collapsing is not lower down
/// on the screen.
///
/// Then there are widgets that need no identifiers at all, like labels,
/// because they have no state nor are interacted with.
///
/// This is niche-optimized to that `Option<Id>` is the same size as `Id`.
