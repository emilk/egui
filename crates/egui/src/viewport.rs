//! egui supports multiple viewports, corresponding to multiple native windows.
//!
//! Not all egui backends support multiple viewports, but `eframe` native does
//! (but not on web).
//!
//! You can spawn a new viewport using [`Context::show_viewport_deferred`] and [`Context::show_viewport_immediate`].
//! These needs to be called every frame the viewport should be visible.
//!
//! This is implemented by the native `eframe` backend, but not the web one.
//!
//! ## Viewport classes
//! The viewports form a tree of parent-child relationships.
//!
//! There are different classes of viewports.
//!
//! ### Root viewport
//! The root viewport is the original viewport, and cannot be closed without closing the application.
//!
//! ### Deferred viewports
//! These are created with [`Context::show_viewport_deferred`].
//! Deferred viewports take a closure that is called by the integration at a later time, perhaps multiple times.
//! Deferred viewports are repainted independenantly of the parent viewport.
//! This means communication with them needs to be done via channels, or `Arc/Mutex`.
//!
//! This is the most performant type of child viewport, though a bit more cumbersome to work with compared to immediate viewports.
//!
//! ### Immediate viewports
//! These are created with [`Context::show_viewport_immediate`].
//! Immediate viewports take a `FnOnce` closure, similar to other egui functions, and is called immediately.
//! This makes communication with them much simpler than with deferred viewports, but this simplicity comes at a cost: whenever the parent viewports needs to be repainted, so will the child viewport, and vice versa.
//! This means that if you have `N` viewports you are potentially doing `N` times as much CPU work. However, if all your viewports are showing animations, and thus are repainting constantly anyway, this doesn't matter.
//!
//! In short: immediate viewports are simpler to use, but can waste a lot of CPU time.
//!
//! ### Embedded viewports
//! These are not real, independent viewports, but is a fallback mode for when the integration does not support real viewports. In your callback is called with [`ViewportClass::Embedded`] it means you need to create a [`crate::Window`] to wrap your ui in, which will then be embedded in the parent viewport, unable to escape it.
//!
//!
//! ## Using the viewports
//! Only one viewport is active at any one time, identified with [`Context::viewport_id`].
//! You can modify the current (change the title, resize the window, etc) by sending
//! a [`ViewportCommand`] to it using [`Context::send_viewport_cmd`].
//! You can interact with other viewports using [`Context::send_viewport_cmd_to`].
//!
//! There is an example in <https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/examples/multiple_viewports/src/main.rs>.
//!
//! You can find all available viewports in [`crate::RawInput::viewports`] and the active viewport in
//! [`crate::InputState::viewport`]:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # let ctx = &egui::Context::default();
//! ctx.input(|i| {
//!     dbg!(&i.viewport()); // Current viewport
//!     dbg!(&i.raw.viewports); // All viewports
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! ## For integrations
//! * There is a [`crate::InputState::viewport`] with information about the current viewport.
//! * There is a [`crate::RawInput::viewports`] with information about all viewports.
//! * The repaint callback set by [`Context::set_request_repaint_callback`] points to which viewport should be repainted.
//! * [`crate::FullOutput::viewport_output`] is a list of viewports which should result in their own independent windows.
//! * To support immediate viewports you need to call [`Context::set_immediate_viewport_renderer`].
//! * If you support viewports, you need to call [`Context::set_embed_viewports`] with `false`, or all new viewports will be embedded (the default behavior).
//!
//! ## Future work
//! There are several more things related to viewports that we want to add.
//! Read more at <https://github.com/emilk/egui/issues/3556>.
