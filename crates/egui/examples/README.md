There are no stand-alone egui examples, because egui is not stand-alone!

See the top-level [examples](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/examples/) folder instead.

There are also plenty of examples in [the online demo](https://www.egui.rs/#demo). You can find the source code for it at <https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/crates/egui_demo_lib>.

To learn how to set up `eframe` for web and native, go to <https://github.com/emilk/eframe_template/> and follow the instructions there!
