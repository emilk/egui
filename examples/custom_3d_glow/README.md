This demo shows how to embed 3D rendering using [`glow`](https://github.com/grovesNL/glow) in `eframe`.

This is very advanced usage, and you need to be careful.

If you want an easier way to show 3D graphics with egui, take a look at the `custom_3d_three-d.rs` example.

If you are content of having egui sit on top of a 3D background, take a look at:

* [`bevy_egui`](https://github.com/mvlabat/bevy_egui)
* [`three-d`](https://github.com/asny/three-d)


```sh
cargo run -p custom_3d_glow
```
