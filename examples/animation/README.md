This demo shows how to perform animation using `animate_value_with_time` to adjust the opacity of a rectangle over time.

Also demonstrated here is how to use `clear_animations` and reset the animated value which is required to ensure smooth transitions if animation times differ for fade in and fade out.

Click the **Animate** button to toggle the opacity of the rectangle with animation.

```sh
cargo run -p animation
```
