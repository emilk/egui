## Button

- If hovering a button add a stroke, the ui shift. Maybe add the option to avoid this resize by making the frame smaller ?

## Label

- I understand checking if a sense has been set by the user, but why check if it's different than hover ? Is it for technical purpose or purely to avoid confusion with a link ?

- Selecting the text while being underlined move the underline
