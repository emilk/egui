//! Backend-agnostic interface for writing apps using [`egui`].
//!
//! `epi` provides interfaces for window management and serialization.
//! An app written for `epi` can then be plugged into [`eframe`](https://docs.rs/eframe),
//! the egui framework crate.
//!
//! Start by looking at the [`App`] trait, and implement [`App::update`].
