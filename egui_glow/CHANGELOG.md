# Changelog for egui_glow
All notable changes to the `egui_glow` integration will be noted in this file.


## Unreleased
`egui_glow` has been newly created, with feature parity to `egui_glium`.
As `glow` is a set of lower-level bindings to OpenGL, this crate is potentially less stable than `egui_glium`,
but there are no known issues, and the crate will only become more stable over time, if any issues manifest.
